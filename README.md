# Overview

Hogwarts Legacy does not officially support macOS, but with **Heroic Games Launcher**, **Wine**, and a few configuration tweaks, the game runs smoothly—even at **60 FPS on Ultra settings** on powerful Apple Silicon machines.

---

* **CPU:** 16‑core (12 performance + 4 efficiency)
* **GPU:** 40‑core Apple M4 Max
* **Memory:** 64 GB unified memory
* **Metal:** Version 4

> ⚡ **For maximum performance:** Enable **High Power Mode** and keep the Mac **plugged in** while gaming.

* Epic Games account
* ~100GB free disk space

---

# Step-by-Step Installation

### **1. Install Heroic Games Launcher**

Download from: [https://heroicgameslauncher.com/](https://heroicgameslauncher.com/)

### **2. Log in to Epic Games inside Heroic**

Your Hogwarts Legacy license will appear in the library.

### **3. Download Hogwarts Legacy**

* Size: **~88GB**

### **4. Open Game Settings**

Heroic → Library → Hogwarts Legacy → Settings.

### **5. Select the Wine section**

Configure Wine runtime options.

### **6. Open WineTricks**

This will allow you to install required Windows components.

### **7. Fix missing dependencies**

Any missing DLLs or components shown in logs must be installed.

### **8. Install `vcrun2022`**

Search for it inside WineTricks → Install.

### **9. Launch the Game**

If shaders fail to build the first time, close and relaunch.

---

# Performance Tips

* **Energy Mode:** Set to **High Power** (System Settings → Battery).
* **Keep charging:** Apple Silicon boosts performance when plugged in.
* **Graphics settings:** Ultra is playable on M4 Max; adjust if needed.
* **Background processes:** Close heavy apps (Chrome, Docker, etc.).

# Known Issues & Fixes

### **Shaders didn’t build on first launch**

* Happens sometimes on Wine.
* Quit the game → launch again → shaders will begin compiling.

### **AMD Driver Outdated popup**

* Wine may show a warning claiming the "AMD GPU driver is outdated".
* Safe to ignore — macOS GPU drivers aren’t user‑managed.

# FAQ

### **Does this work on Intel Macs?**

Not reliably. This guide is for **Apple Silicon only**.

### **Is performance good?**

On M4 Max: **60 FPS Ultra** in most areas.
On M1/M2: Medium–High may be more realistic.

### **Do I need Proton or CrossOver?**

Heroic + Wine is enough.

# ❗ Disclaimer

This is an unofficial workaround. Hogwarts Legacy has **no native macOS version**, and compatibility can vary between machines, Wine versions, and game patches.

Use at your own discretion.
